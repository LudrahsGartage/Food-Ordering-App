## Some Cool Things to Remember!

- It uses a single event listener and conditional statements to identify the interation and respond appropiately.
- We use data property of elements to identify the objects in the event listeners.
- All the generation of html is done via an array of objects. We use the array method "for each" to render the entire menu and cart then use the DOM to show it on the screen.
- Conditional styling for the modal is done via DOM and css, using the toggle display to none property.
